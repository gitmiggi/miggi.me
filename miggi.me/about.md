<p>My name is <strong>Miguel Angel Cardona, Jr.</strong> I am a designer, illustrator, photographer, and creative developer. Currently the Lead Designer at <a href="http://www.imgix.com" class="text-link">imgix</a> in San Francisco, CA. I was previously a Visting Professor at the <a href="http://cias.rit.edu/schools/design" title="RIT School of Design" target="_blank">School of Design at RIT</a> and a coâ€“founder of <a href="http://www.dwaiter.com" title="Dumbwaiter Design" target="_blank">Dumbwaiter Design</a> in Rochester, NY.</p>
  
<p>I spend most of my time wandering the Bay Area with a cache of markers and a sketchbook in pursuit of inspiration. I can usually be found drawing on paper <a href="http://sketchcups.com" title="Sketch Cups" target="_blank">coffee cups</a> in one of my neighborhood cafes.</p>
