My name is **Miguel Angel Cardona, Jr.** I am a designer, illustrator, photographer, and creative developer. Currently the Lead Designer at [imgix](https://imgix.com) in San Francisco, CA. I was previously a Visting Professor at the [RIT School for Design](http://cias.rit.edu/schools/design) and a coâ€“founder of [Dumbwaiter Design](http://www.dwaiter.com) in Rochester, NY.
  
I spend most of my time wandering the Bay Area with a cache of markers and a sketchbook in pursuit of inspiration. I can usually be found drawing on paper <a href="http://sketchcups.com" title="Sketch Cups" target="_blank">coffee cups</a> in one of my neighborhood cafes.
