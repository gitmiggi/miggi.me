	My name is <strong>Miguel Angel Cardona, Jr.</strong> I am a designer, illustrator, photographer, and creative developer.

	I spend most of my time wandering the Bay Area with a cache of markers and a sketchbook in pursuit of inspiration. I can usually be found drawing on paper <a href="http://sketchcups.com" title="Sketch Cups" target="_blank">coffee cups</a> in one of my neighborhood cafes.
