<section>
	<p><a href="https://imgix.com" target="_blank">imgix</a> provides highly-specialized infrastructure designed specifically for working with images and other visual media efficiently at scale. This includes basic image manipulation, on-demand resizing, animated gif tools, palette extraction, image statistics, face detection, and basic image analysis.</p>

<blockquote>imgix is a globally distributed, real time image processing platform built in response to a rapidly evolving and increasingly visual Internet.

	<p>Within a small startup a Lead Designer wears many hats. At imgix, I have had the oppurtunity to get my hands dirty on many aspects of the product and own a number of initiatives. The main one of those being the marketing site, imgix.com. I have had the oppurtunity to visually and organizationally revamp the site numerous times as we grow and develop as a company.</p>
	<p>I handle much of the CSS/HTML styling, have authored some of the interactive bits and non-supertechnical structure. In the case of our main site, I am a designer who <i>'pushes to master'.</i>.</p>

	<p>As we mature as a company, and test out new initiatives, messaging and content, I work closely with the various levels of the company including sales, marketing, product, and infrastructure to maintain consistency.</p>
	<p>The site itself makes heavy use of our product, our front-end libraries, and imgix features like auto content negotiation to help lighten the page weight and improve user experience.</p>
	<p>I strive to maintain consistency in our branding colors, the imagery used, and the overall style of the company as being vivid, saturated and rich with a juxtaposition of vector graphics and high detail imagery.</p>
