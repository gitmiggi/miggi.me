<p>The process for memory keeping in the digital age has become easier, immediate, and more efficient thanks to the advent of sophisticated pocket-sized toolsets that can capture everyday experiences. Consumer-level photo and video recording products are introduced regularly and boast more fidelity, faster speeds, and greater control than their predecessors. More often than not, these expanding feature sets do not properly serve all of their users’ needs.</p>

<p>While the technology exists to allow for a nearcomplete record of one’s life to be made through the use of sensors and storage media, problems involve how best to meaningfully learn from and engage with a lifetime of collected content. With the intention of designing a system to streamline the storage and review process of digital memory keeping, I devised a conceptual framework of tangible objects and interactions to centralize memory media and provide a tangible experience for the review of life content.</p>

<p>Focusing on the design of products for “lifelogging,” the recording of everyday experience through digital sensory inputs, I researched human memory, memory making processes, and the Quantified Self movement.</p>

<p>My resulting concept is a system of interactions that incorporate physical objects, digital interfaces, wireless communication, and cloud– based storage that is meant to be a tactile, precious, and centralized way to review and engage with one’s memory.</p>

<p>Sketchbooked started out as my productive procrastination / "design-a-day" illustration series of facebook and twitter friends' profile photos, and posts. It is now more of a process book of my digital and analog portrait illustrations. The purpose of the site is to explore notions of social media, relationships, and engage with others using my art and design.</p>
