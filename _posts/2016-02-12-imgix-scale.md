<section>
<p>imgix Scale is a utility in the spirit of Google Page Speed to measure page weight and room for improvement for image optimization. A user enters in a URL, and the result is a report on image optimization, and potential size.</p>
<p>The project doubles as a sales tool for imgix as it educates users on what images are currently bogging down their site, as well as their current rankings against other sites as reported by the top sites in the Internet Archive.</p>
